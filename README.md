# ZombieDefense

The final project for validation for the training program in Madpoly Studio (VNG)

This project has to be done in 3 days (from July 4th to July 6th) and presented on July 7th (I managed to squeeze in 3 more commits before presenting)

Every commit after July 7th is my attempt to make the game feel more finished
